# Apple-Stock-Prediction
#Skills Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy, Lstm, Time_Step, Neural Network

#Project Obective
LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. In this Project we used LSTM to predict stock Close prediction. I used timestep to help me do this.

#Quantifiable Results
We could predict the stock Close for the day with 89% accuracy
